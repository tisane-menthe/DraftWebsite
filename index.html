<h1> Links to my webpages draft </h1>
  <p> <strong>!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!</strong> 
    Please use either Mozilla or Chrome as those web browsers are the ones I tested, and I know they render the sketches as they are supposed to. 
Safari has some problem with WEBGL and opacity, I know how to fix the bug (just sending different blendmode etc based on browser) but it takes time so I'll do it later. </p>

  
  
<h2> Final (?) Finalllllll </h2>
  <a href="https://tisane-menthe.github.io/DraftWebsite/pages/final/">click here </a>
<p> I am finally starting to implement things and this look should be close to the final one. From now on, all developments will take place in this link, and the other links are just here in case I'm drafting some random ideas.  </p>
  
<h2> Grid: first version </h2>
  <a href="https://tisane-menthe.github.io/DraftWebsite/pages/Grid/">click here </a>
<p> I first thought of using it as main landing page but I think we could also use it as landing page for the zine only. </p>

<h2> Grid: second version </h2>
  <a href="https://tisane-menthe.github.io/DraftWebsite/pages/GridTrippy/">click here </a>

<p> A second, more trippy version that we probably would not use as main template but could be hidden somewhere in the website. </p>

<h2> Landing page: first version </h2>
    <a href="https://tisane-menthe.github.io/DraftWebsite/pages/LandingPage/">click here </a>
<p> This is what I worked on as landing page. I am really not satisfied with it so absolutely subject to change! </p>

<h2> Landing page: second version </h2>
    <a href="https://tisane-menthe.github.io/DraftWebsite/pages/LandingPage2/">click here </a>

<p> Same as above </p>
  
  
 <h2> Landing page: third version version </h2>
    <a href="https://tisane-menthe.github.io/DraftWebsite/pages/landing_page_V3/">click here </a>

<p> New version of the landing page ! I like it better ! </p>
