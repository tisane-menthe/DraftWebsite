<h1> Links to my webpages draft </h1>
<p> !!!! Please use either Mozilla or Chrome as web browsers are those are the ones I tested that I now render the sketch as they are supposed to. 
Safari has some problem with WEBGL and opacity, I know how to fix the bug (just sending different blendmode etc based on browser) but it takes time so I'll do it later. </p>

<h2> Grid: first version </h2>
<p> I first thought of using it as main landing page but I think we could also use it as landing page for the zine only. </p>

<h2> Grid: second version </h2>
<p> A second, more trippy version that we probably would not use as main template but could be hidden somewhere in the website. </p>

<h2> Landing page: first version </h2>
<p> This is what I worked on as landing page. I am really not satisfied with it so absolutely subject to change! </p>

<h2> Landing page: second version </h2>
<p> Same as above </p>
